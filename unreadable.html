				<h2>Science in brief</h2>
				<p>Leaves are green during the growing season because of chlorophyll. As days shorten and temperatures fall, trees reclaim nutrients and chlorophyll breaks down. Other pigments—carotenoids (yellows/oranges), anthocyanins (reds/purples), and tannins (browns)—become visible or are produced, creating autumn color.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Key factors</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Daylength:</strong> Shorter days trigger the seasonal changes.</li>
					<li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Cool nights and sunny days favor bright reds and clear golds.</li>
					<li><strong>Moisture:</strong> Adequate (but not extreme) moisture helps; drought can dull colors.</li>
					<li><strong>Species &amp; health:</strong> Different trees show different colors; stressed trees may color early or faintly.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Simple timeline</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Late summer: chlorophyll breakdown begins.</li>
					<li>Early-mid autumn: pigments peak in many regions.</li>
					<li>Late autumn: pigments fade and leaves fall.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>What's in a red?</h2>
				<p>Anthocyanins form in some species when sugars become trapped in leaves under sunny days and cool nights. They may protect leaf tissues and can intensify red shades.</p>

				<h2>Tips for a walk</h2>
				<p>Bring a notebook: note species, temperature, and sky. Compare sunlit and shaded sides of trees—reds usually intensify in direct light. Hilltops and lake margins often change first.</p>
				<p>“It is not so much that the leaves change as that the trees practice letting go.”</p>

				<h2>Quick reference</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Primary pigments: chlorophyll, carotenoids, anthocyanins, tannins</li>
					<li>Best viewing: sunny days + cool, frost-free nights</li>
					<li>Typical peak: varies by region (often mid-late autumn)</li>
				</ul>
